# SQL - GA_SESSION  
In this project, I explore user behavior data by writing 8 SQL queries in Google BigQuery, based on the Google Analytics sample dataset â€” specifically focusing on the ga_sessions table.  
## 1. Introduce
Source: Google Analytics sample dataset  
Table: bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_*
